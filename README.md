# Face Emotion Detection
This project aims to classify the emotion on a person's face into one of seven categories, using deep convolutional neural networks.
It mainly focuses on 7 different emotions namely angry, surprise, happy, sad, neutral, fear and disgusted.
It mainly identifies emotion of any image given and it can also work through webcam video so that it directly classifies the emotion in live.

**For the identification of emotion through image uploaded the following link can be accessed for th code:**

For this you ned to upload the image in the colab notebook. Then itself the image can be easily available for the model to classify the emotion in it.

**Through webcam :**
one can clone this github repo and once all the folders of this project comes into availability just open through visualstudio code or any other preferrable developing tool. 
Then open the videoteste.py file and run it
